The only part tough in blogging should be writing. Other stuff should be easy enough to focus on nothing else but writing.

Here is my first attempt to **automate** posting any _markdown_ file to my github repository using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Hope this proves to be useful. *Fingers crossed.*
