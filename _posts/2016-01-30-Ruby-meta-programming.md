#Ruby meta-programming

Before starting with ruby meta-programming, one should clearly understand the ruby object model.
Here are some great videos explaining the same:


* [The Ruby Object Model by Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2sgQ38UDVY).
* [A Deep Dive into the Ruby Object Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by5fFOBhtPQ).



[RubyMonk](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books) provides two courses on meta-programming.

* Metaprogramming Ruby
* Metaprogramming Ruby: Ascent

Please go through the same if you are a beginner to meta-programming.

ALL THE BEST!!!
