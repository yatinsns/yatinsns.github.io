Few weeks back, I watched ***"The Imitation Game"*** movie based on real life story of cryptanlyst ___Alan Turing___  trying to crack Nazi codes during Second World War. What got me stick to the movie is the art of **Cryptography** used from that period of time.

After attending one session on the same topic from my senior, I have decided to understand cryptography in depth. 

	To begin with I have started working on [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com). It seems to be great resource for learning with some coding as well.
	
I am not sure how long I will be able to maintain this interest. Hoping for the best.

***Fingers crossed.***
