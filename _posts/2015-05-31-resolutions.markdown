2015 Resolution
----------------

**"To make a resolution every year"** is my resolution for the rest of my life. Why so? To help my son learn things I know.

In 2014, I made a resolution to start learning table tennis. I went for professional coaching for about nine months, just enough to compete my colleagues in office tournament and playing it with confidence.

For 2015 my resolution is to read three books every month. Making up a list on [GoodReads.com] (www.goodreads.com). I know its hard. But what's the fun in simple resolutions. Something to keep you challenging makes life interesting and meaningful.

Thanks to my wife, who doesn't get annoyed watching a huge pile of books in my wardrobe.
