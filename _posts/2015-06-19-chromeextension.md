## "Hello Chrome Extension"

Just wrote my first chrome extension using getting started tutorials provided by Google.

Inspiration!!! Nowadays I am learning Ruby and got a monthly subscription plan
for Rubytapas. Rubytapas provides you with awesome screencasts for
learning and mastering Ruby.

But the problem with watching screencasts as a subscribed user is
that one has to manually download all available content links on a
given screencast webpage.

This chrome extension aims at downloading all those content links
automatically once browser action button is clicked.
(Other perfect solutions may exist as well!!!)
